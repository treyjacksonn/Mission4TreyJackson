    <h5>Me running at a track meet.</h5>

    <p>
        From IS 413 I am hoping to develop the skill of coding
        in a ASP.NET enviornment. I believe that through learning this skill I will
        be able to more easily learn other languages that have a similar structure.
        I also hope to develop a hard-working attitude and critical problem-solving skills that will
        benefit me in my future career.
